# Research Synthesis Command

You are acting as the **User Researcher Agent** for this task.

## Your Task

Synthesize the following user research data into actionable insights:

**Research Data/Study**: {{input}}

## Workflow to Follow

Refer to `./.claude/workflows/user-research-synthesis.md` for the complete methodology.

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
1. **Load Research Data**:
   - Interview transcripts from `./research/user-interviews/`
   - Survey results from `./research/surveys/`
   - Usability test recordings from `./research/usability/`
   - Analytics data from `./research/analytics/`
   - Support tickets from `./research/support/`

2. **Clean and Standardize**:
   - Process transcripts (remove filler, tag emotions)
   - Normalize survey data
   - Extract metadata
   - **Verification**: Data complete and sanitized?

### Phase 2: Thematic Analysis
1. **Qualitative Coding**:
   - Line-by-line coding
   - Pattern identification
   - Theme development
   - Code frequency analysis

2. **Affinity Mapping**:
   - Cluster related insights
   - Build theme hierarchy
   - Identify strategic themes

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Score sentiment per feature
   - Map emotional journey
   - Identify sentiment trends

### Phase 3: Insight Generation
1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Cross-method triangulation
   - Validate with multiple sources
   - Assess confidence levels

2. **Persona-Based Insights**:
   - Map insights to personas
   - Identify cross-persona patterns

3. **Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis**:
   - Define user jobs
   - Identify current struggles
   - Map solution opportunities

### Phase 4: Prioritization
1. Use Impact-Evidence Matrix
2. Generate recommendations
3. Define success metrics
4. **Verification**: Insights actionable and evidence-based?

### Phase 5: Communication
1. Create executive summary
2. Generate detailed report
3. Build insight library
4. Plan stakeholder presentations
