## Confidence Assessment

### Overall Confidence Score: X.X/10

**Calculation**:
- Evidence quality: X/10 (average source score × weight)
- Source diversity: X/10 (qual + quant + multiple methods)
- Sample adequacy: X/10 (size and representativeness)
- Triangulation: X/10 (convergence across sources)
- **Average**: X.X/10

**Confidence Level Interpretation**:
- **9-10 (Very High)**: Strong evidence from multiple quality sources, clear patterns
- **7-8 (High)**: Good evidence with some triangulation, minor gaps
- **5-6 (Medium)**: Moderate evidence, some gaps or conflicts
- **3-4 (Low)**: Limited evidence, significant gaps, weak sources
- **1-2 (Very Low)**: Insufficient evidence, unreliable sources

### Decision Recommendation

Based on this evidence:

✅ **Proceed with confidence** (Confidence ≥ 8/10)
- Evidence strongly supports decision
- Minimal gaps and strong triangulation
- Risks well understood and manageable

⚠️ **Proceed with caution** (Confidence 5-7/10)
- Evidence supports decision but with gaps
- Monitor key assumptions and risks
- Plan for iteration and learning

❌ **Need more research** (Confidence < 5/10)
- Evidence insufficient for confident decision
- Critical gaps or conflicts unresolved
- Recommend additional research before proceeding

**Current Status**: [Select one above and explain]

## Usage Guidelines

**When to create an evidence log**:
- Making significant product decisions
- Building case for stakeholder alignment
- Documenting research for future reference
- Systematically evaluating evidence quality

**How to maintain**:
1. Add new evidence as it's collected
2. Update quality scores as context changes
3. Reassess confidence periodically
4. Document new gaps as they're identified
5. Link to related decision documents
6. Archive when decision is made and validated

**Tips for effectiveness**:
- Be rigorous about quality assessment
- Document limitations honestly
- Note conflicts and how they're resolved
- Keep updated as new evidence emerges
- Make it easy to reference in discussions
- Use consistent IDs for cross-referencing
