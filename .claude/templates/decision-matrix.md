## Usage Guidelines

**When to use this template**:
- Comparing 2+ distinct options
- Need systematic, objective evaluation
- Building stakeholder consensus
- Documenting decision rationale
- High-stakes or irreversible decisions

**How to complete**:
1. Define decision and options clearly
2. Select 5-7 relevant criteria (not too many)
3. Assign weights BEFORE scoring (avoid bias)
4. Define scoring rubrics for consistency
5. Score with stakeholder input
6. Calculate and analyze results
7. Perform sensitivity analysis
8. Document recommendation and rationale
9. Get stakeholder sign-off
10. Track and validate after implementation

**Tips for success**:
- Keep criteria independent (no overlap)
- Weight criteria before seeing scores
- Use evidence to support scores
- Involve relevant stakeholders in scoring
- Test sensitivity to weights and scores
- Make trade-offs explicit
- Plan for validation and learning
