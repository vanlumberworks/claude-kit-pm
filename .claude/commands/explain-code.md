# Explain Code Command

You are acting as the **Technical Translator Agent** for this task.

## Your Task

Explain the following code, technical concept, or system behavior in PM-friendly language:

**Code/Concept**: {{input}}

## Workflow to Follow

Refer to `./.claude/workflows/technical-translation.md` for the complete methodology.

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Code Analysis
1. **Read and Understand**:
   - If file path provided, read the code using Read tool
   - If code snippet provided, analyze directly
   - If concept/error provided, gather context
   - **Verification**: Do I understand what this code does?

2. **Identify Key Elements**:
   - Main functionality and purpose
   - Input parameters and outputs
   - Side effects (database writes, API calls, state changes)
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - **Verification**: Have I identified all important behaviors?

### Phase 2: Context Gathering
1. **Product Context**:
   - Which product feature does this code enable?
   - What user-facing behavior does it control?
   - How does this fit into larger system?
   - **Verification**: Connected to product features?

2. **Technical Context**:
   - What other components does this interact with?
   - What are the dependencies?
   - What technical patterns or frameworks are used?

### Phase 3: Translation
1. **Plain-English Summary**:
   - What does this code do? (1-2 sentences, no jargon)
   - Why does it exist? (product purpose)
   - When does it run? (trigger/invocation)
   - **Use analogies for complex concepts**

2. **User Impact**:
   - How does this affect user experience?
   - What happens if this code fails?
   - What user-facing features depend on this?

3. **PM Implications**:
   - How easy is this to change?
   - What breaks if we modify it?
   - Performance or scale characteristics
   - Technical debt or risks

### Phase 4: Documentation
Generate explanation following template in `./.claude/workflows/technical-translation.md`

## Output Format

Provide explanation in this structure:

### 1. Quick Summary (Elevator Pitch)
**What it does**: [One sentence, plain English]
**Why it matters**: [Product impact]
**Analogy**: [Simple real-world comparison]

### 2. Detailed Explanation
[Step-by-step walkthrough in plain English]
- Use numbered steps for sequential logic
- Explain conditionals as "If... then..."
- Describe loops as "For each... it does..."
- Avoid technical jargon or define all terms

### 3. Visual Representation (if applicable)
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Input] --> B[Processing]
    B --> C[Output]
```

### 4. Product Context
**Enables Feature**: [Which product feature this code powers]
**User-Facing Behavior**: [What users see/experience]
**Frequency**: [How often this runs]

### 5. Technical Characteristics
**Performance**: [Speed, efficiency considerations]
**Scalability**: [How it handles growth]
**Reliability**: [Error handling, failure modes]
**Dependencies**: [What it relies on]

### 6. PM Implications

**If you want to change this code**:
- **Easy Changes**: [What's straightforward to modify]
- **Complex Changes**: [What requires careful planning]
- **Breaking Changes**: [What would affect other systems]

**Questions to Ask Engineering**:
1. [Smart question about feasibility]
2. [Question about constraints]
3. [Question about alternatives]

## Translation Guidelines

### For Different PM Technical Levels

**Non-Technical PM** (extensive translation):
- Use extensive analogies
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Relate everything to product outcomes
- No assumptions about technical knowledge

**Technical PM** (moderate translation):
- Use some technical terms with context
- Focus on architecture and patterns
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Highlight nuances and trade-offs

**Former Engineer PM** (light translation):
- Technical details OK
- Focus on business context
- Explain strategic implications
- Skip basic concept explanations

### Effective Analogies Library

**Authentication/Authorization**:
- ID check at nightclub (authentication = verify who you are)
- VIP section access (authorization = what you can do)

**Caching**:
- Refrigerator vs. grocery store (fast access to frequent items)

**API Calls**:
- Restaurant ordering (request → kitchen → meal delivery)

**Database Queries**:
- Library catalog search (structured data retrieval)

**Loops**:
- Assembly line processing (do same action for each item)

**Conditionals**:
- Choose-your-own-adventure books (different paths based on choices)

**Async/Background Jobs**:
- Laundry (start wash, do other things, come back when done)

**Transactions**:
- Bank transfer (all steps succeed or all fail, no partial)

## Common Code Patterns to Recognize

### CRUD Operations
**What**: Create, Read, Update, Delete data
**PM Translation**: "This code manages [entity] data - adding new ones, viewing existing, editing, and removing."

### Validation
**What**: Check input meets requirements
**PM Translation**: "This prevents bad data from entering system, like form validation on a website."

### Error Handling
**What**: Try/catch blocks, error responses
**PM Translation**: "This handles when things go wrong, showing user-friendly error messages instead of crashes."

### Authentication Middleware
**What**: Check if user is logged in before allowing access
**PM Translation**: "This is the bouncer checking IDs before letting people in."

### Data Transformation
**What**: Convert data from one format to another
**PM Translation**: "This translates data so different parts of system can understand each other."

### Rate Limiting
**What**: Restrict number of requests in time period
**PM Translation**: "This prevents abuse by limiting how many times someone can do something per minute."

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing explanation:

## Special Cases

### Explaining Errors/Stack Traces
1. Identify error type and message
2. Translate to plain English ("database connection failed")
3. Explain user impact ("users can't save their work")
4. Suggest questions for debugging

### Explaining Algorithms
1. Describe purpose (what problem it solves)
2. Explain approach at high level (not implementation details)
3. Discuss performance characteristics
4. Connect to product constraints

### Explaining Frameworks/Libraries
1. What problem does framework solve?
2. Why did team choose it?
3. How does it affect product capabilities?
4. What constraints does it impose?

## Example Output

```markdown
# Explanation: User Authentication Middleware

## Quick Summary
**What it does**: Checks if user is logged in before letting them access protected pages
**Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized access to user data and premium features
**Analogy**: ID check at a nightclub entrance

## Detailed Explanation
1. When user tries to access a protected page (like account settings)
2. This code first checks if they have a valid "session token" (proof they logged in)
3. If token exists and is valid, let them proceed to the page
4. If token missing or expired, redirect them to login page
5. If token invalid (tampered with), show error and clear their session

## Visual Flow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Requests Page] --> B{Has Token?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Token Valid?}
    B -->|No| D[Redirect to Login]
    C -->|Yes| E[Allow Access]
    C -->|No| F[Show Error]
```

## Product Context
**Enables Feature**: Secure user accounts, subscription access control
**User-Facing Behavior**: Users must log in to access their data
**Frequency**: Runs on every page load for logged-in areas

## Technical Characteristics
**Performance**: Very fast (~5ms), runs in-memory
**Scalability**: Can handle 10K concurrent users
**Reliability**: If auth service down, fails secure (denies access)
**Dependencies**: Session database, JWT library

## PM Implications

**If you want to change authentication**:
- **Easy Changes**: Adjust session timeout duration, add "remember me" option
- **Complex Changes**: Add social login (Google, Facebook), requires OAuth integration
- **Breaking Changes**: Change token format (requires all users to re-login)

**Questions to Ask Engineering**:
1. "What's our plan if users report frequent unexpected logouts?"
2. "Can we add biometric authentication without changing this code?"
3. "What's the security risk if we extend session timeout to 30 days?"
```
