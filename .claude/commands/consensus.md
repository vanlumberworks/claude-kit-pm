# Consensus Building Command

You are acting as the **Consensus Builder Agent** for this task.

## Your Task

Facilitate stakeholder alignment and build consensus on:

**Topic/Decision**: {{input}}

## Workflow to Follow

Refer to `./.claude/workflows/consensus-report.md` for the complete methodology.

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Preparation and Planning

1. **Define the Decision**:
   - Clear, concise decision statement
   - Context: Why this decision is needed now
   - Scope: What's in scope vs. out of scope
   - Impact: Who/what is affected
   - Constraints: Technical, business, resource, timeline
   - **Verification**: Decision clearly defined?

2. **Map Stakeholders**:
   - Identify all parties who should have input
   - Create stakeholder list with:
     - Role and responsibility
     - Interest level (High/Medium/Low)
     - Power/influence (High/Medium/Low)
     - Engagement approach
   - Use Power-Interest Matrix to prioritize engagement
   - **Verification**: All key stakeholders identified?

3. **Gather Background Evidence**:
   - Check for existing research in `./outputs/research-reports/`
   - Review relevant analytics
   - Check competitor analysis
   - Look for previous decisions in `./decisions/`
   - **Use**: Evidence log template if needed
   - **Verification**: Relevant evidence collected?

### Phase 2: Position Collection

1. **Conduct Stakeholder Interviews** (or review provided positions):
   For each stakeholder, document:
   - **Position**: What they advocate for
   - **Priority**: P0 (Critical) to P3 (Nice-to-have)
   - **Reasoning**: Why they hold this position
   - **Underlying Interests**: What they're really trying to achieve
   - **Key Concerns**: What worries them
   - **Trade-offs Willing to Make**: Where they're flexible
   - **Red Lines**: Non-negotiables
   - **Success Metrics**: How they'd measure success
   - **Confidence**: High/Medium/Low in their position

2. **Create Stakeholder Position Matrix**:
   ```
   ┌───────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
   │ Issue/Feature │ Engineering│   Design   │  Sales   │  Support │
   ├───────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
   │ Position      │ [Position] │ [Position] │[Position]│[Position]│
   │ Priority      │ P[0-3]     │ P[0-3]     │ P[0-3]   │ P[0-3]   │
   │ Reasoning     │ [Why]      │ [Why]      │ [Why]    │ [Why]    │
   │ Key Concern   │ [Concern]  │ [Concern]  │[Concern] │[Concern] │
   │ Success Metric│ [Metric]   │ [Metric]   │ [Metric] │ [Metric] │
   └───────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴──────────┴──────────┘

   Initial Alignment Score: X.X/5.0
   ```
   - **Output**: `./outputs/consensus-reports/[topic]-positions-[date].md`
   - **Verification**: All positions clearly documented?

3. **Calculate Initial Alignment Score** (0-5 scale):
   - 5.0: Full consensus, all agree
   - 4.0: Strong alignment, minor differences
   - 3.0: Moderate alignment, can work with it
   - 2.0: Weak alignment, significant concerns
   - 1.0: No alignment, fundamental disagreement

### Phase 3: Conflict Analysis and Resolution

1. **Identify Conflicts**:
   - Priority conflicts (different urgency assessments)
   - Approach conflicts (different solution preferences)
   - Resource conflicts (limited capacity)
   - Value conflicts (different success definitions)
   - Timeline conflicts (different schedule needs)
   - **Rate severity**: 1-5 (5 = blocking, 1 = minor)

2. **Analyze Root Causes**:
   For each major conflict:
   - **Surface positions**: What stakeholders are saying
   - **Underlying interests**: What they really need
   - **Real issue**: Information gap vs. value difference vs. misunderstanding
   - **Resolution approaches**: 3+ potential ways to resolve

3. **Explore Solutions**:
   - **Interest-Based Approach**: Focus on interests, not positions
   - **Creative Options**:
     - Expand resources
     - Phase the solution
     - Hybrid approaches
     - Run experiments
     - Trade across issues
   - **Compromises**: What each party willing to give up

4. **Build Trade-off Framework**:
   ```
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ CONFLICT: [Description]                               │
   ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ POSITIONS             │ INTERESTS                     │
   ├───────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┤
   │ Party A: [Position]   │ Party A: [Real need]          │
   │ Party B: [Position]   │ Party B: [Real need]          │
   ├───────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┤
   │ OPTIONS FOR MUTUAL GAIN                               │
   ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ 1. [Option 1 - addresses both interests]             │
   │ 2. [Option 2 - phased approach]                      │
   │ 3. [Option 3 - hybrid solution]                      │
   ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ CONSENSUS DECISION                                    │
   │ [Selected option and why all parties can support]    │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

### Phase 4: Decision Documentation

1. **Calculate Final Alignment Score**:
   - Assess final positions after discussion/negotiation
   - Calculate improved alignment score
   - Document improvement from initial score
   - **Target**: ≥4.0/5.0 for strong consensus

2. **Document Position Evolution**:
   - How positions changed through process
   - What evidence or discussions shifted perspectives
   - Compromises made by each party
   - Final level of support for each stakeholder

3. **Create Decision Analysis**:
   If multiple options were evaluated:
   - List all options considered
   - Create Multi-Criteria Decision Matrix (MCDA):
     ```
     ┌─────────────┬────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────┐
     │ Criteria    │ Weight │Option A │Option B │Option C │ Best │
     ├─────────────┼────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────┤
     │User Impact  │  30%   │  8/10   │  6/10   │  9/10   │      │
     │Feasibility  │  25%   │  6/10   │  9/10   │  5/10   │      │
     │Business Val │  20%   │  7/10   │  5/10   │  8/10   │      │
     │Risk         │  15%   │  8/10   │  6/10   │  4/10   │      │
     │Speed        │  10%   │  5/10   │  9/10   │  3/10   │      │
     ├─────────────┼────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────┤
     │Total Score  │        │  6.9    │  6.8    │  6.5    │ 6.9🏆│
     └─────────────┴────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────┘
     ```
   - Document why chosen option was selected
   - Explain trade-offs accepted

4. **Create Comprehensive Consensus Report**:

     - Decision Analysis (options, matrix, rationale)
     - Implementation Plan (action items, success metrics, timeline)

   |Metric 2| A       | B      | Date     | Name  | Monthly     |
   ```

3. **Identify and Mitigate Risks**:
   ```
   | Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation | Owner |
   |------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
   |Risk 1| H/M/L       | H/M/L  | [Score]  |[Strategy]  | Name  |
   |Risk 2| H/M/L       | H/M/L  | [Score]  |[Strategy]  | Name  |
   ```

4. **Set Review Schedule**:
   - Check-in meetings (dates and focus areas)
   - Metric review frequency
   - Decision validation criteria
   - Escalation triggers

### Phase 6: Communication and Follow-up

1. **Communication Plan**:
   - Who needs to be informed
   - Communication method and timing
   - Key messages to convey
   - Q&A preparation

2. **Decision Record** (if applicable):
   - Create entry in `./decisions/[topic]-[date].md`
   - Include decision statement, rationale, stakeholder positions
   - Link to full consensus report
   - Set review date

3. **Follow-up Actions**:
   - Schedule check-in meetings
   - Set up tracking system for action items
   - Plan for monitoring and validation
   - Prepare for retrospective
