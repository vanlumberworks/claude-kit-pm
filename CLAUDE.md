## Specialized Agents

- Problem Decomposer: `./.claude/agents/problem-decomposer.md`
- PRD Writer: `./.claude/agents/prd-writer.md`
- User Researcher: `./.claude/agents/user-researcher.md`
- **Research Synthesizer**: `./.claude/agents/research-synthesizer.md` - Multi-source research and evidence evaluation
- **Consensus Builder**: `./.claude/agents/consensus-builder.md` - Stakeholder alignment and conflict resolution

- Prioritization Engine: `./.claude/agents/prioritization-engine.md`
- Analytics Synthesizer: `./.claude/agents/analytics-synthesizer.md`

## Documentation Management

Product documentation maintained in structured directories:
- `./prds/` - Product Requirements Documents
- `./specs/` - Technical Specifications
- `./research/` - User Research & Market Analysis
- `./roadmaps/` - Product Roadmaps & Strategy
- `./metrics/` - KPIs & Analytics Dashboards
- `./decisions/` - Decision Logs & Rationale
- `./frameworks/` - Reusable PM Frameworks
- **`./outputs/research-reports/`** - Research synthesis reports and findings
- **`./outputs/consensus-reports/`** - Stakeholder alignment and consensus documentation
- **`./outputs/decision-matrices/`** - Comparison matrices and decision frameworks
- **`./outputs/evidence-logs/`** - Evidence quality assessments and source documentation

## Available Commands

- `/decompose` - Systematic problem decomposition
- `/prd` - Generate comprehensive PRD
- `/synthesize` - Synthesize research data into insights
- `/prioritize` - Apply prioritization frameworks to features
- `/strategy` - Create strategic planning documents
- `/decide` - Quick decision framework with rationale
- **`/research`** - Comprehensive multi-source research synthesis with confidence scoring
- **`/consensus`** - Build stakeholder consensus and create alignment reports
- **`/matrix`** - Generate comparison matrices and decision frameworks
- **`/evidence`** - Gather and assess evidence quality for data-driven decisions

## System Architecture

This ClaudeKit PM system implements:

1. **Systematic Problem Decomposition** - Breaking complex problems into manageable components
2. **Comprehensive PRD Generation** - Multi-layer validation and verification
3. **Evidence-Based Decision Making** - Multi-source research synthesis with confidence scoring
4. **Stakeholder Consensus Building** - Systematic alignment and conflict resolution
5. **Visual Decision Frameworks** - Comparison matrices and analytical tables for clarity
6. **Cross-functional Coordination** - Structured workflows for team alignment
7. **Consistency Maintenance** - Systematic verification and backtracking
8. **Scalable File System As Context** - Efficient AI-enhanced reasoning chains

## Long Chain-of-Thought Methodology

All workflows implement extended reasoning chains with:
- Multi-phase verification checkpoints
- Iterative refinement protocols
- Backtracking capabilities
- Error correction mechanisms
- Cross-validation between components
