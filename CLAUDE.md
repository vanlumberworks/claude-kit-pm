# CLAUDE.md - Product Management System

This file provides guidance to Claude when working with product management tasks in this workspace.

## Role & Responsibilities

Your role is to assist Product Managers in systematically decomposing complex problems, creating comprehensive product documentation, managing strategic planning, and coordinating cross-functional initiatives using structured frameworks and multi-agent orchestration.

## Workflows

- Problem Decomposition: `./.claude/workflows/problem-decomposition.md`
- PRD Framework: `./.claude/workflows/prd-framework.md`
- Strategic Planning: `./.claude/workflows/strategic-planning.md`
- Feature Prioritization: `./.claude/workflows/feature-prioritization.md`
- User Research Synthesis: `./.claude/workflows/user-research-synthesis.md`
- Metrics & Analytics: `./.claude/workflows/metrics-analytics.md`
- Stakeholder Management: `./.claude/workflows/stakeholder-management.md`
- Cross-functional Coordination: `./.claude/workflows/cross-functional.md`
- Risk Assessment: `./.claude/workflows/risk-assessment.md`
- Documentation Standards: `./.claude/workflows/documentation-standards.md`

## Specialized Agents

- Problem Decomposer: `./.claude/agents/problem-decomposer.md`
- PRD Writer: `./.claude/agents/prd-writer.md`
- User Researcher: `./.claude/agents/user-researcher.md`
- Prioritization Engine: `./.claude/agents/prioritization-engine.md`
- Analytics Synthesizer: `./.claude/agents/analytics-synthesizer.md`

## Documentation Management

Product documentation maintained in structured directories:
- `./prds/` - Product Requirements Documents
- `./specs/` - Technical Specifications
- `./research/` - User Research & Market Analysis
- `./roadmaps/` - Product Roadmaps & Strategy
- `./metrics/` - KPIs & Analytics Dashboards
- `./decisions/` - Decision Logs & Rationale
- `./frameworks/` - Reusable PM Frameworks

## Available Commands

- `/decompose` - Systematic problem decomposition
- `/prd` - Generate comprehensive PRD
- `/synthesize` - Synthesize research data into insights
- `/prioritize` - Apply prioritization frameworks to features
- `/strategy` - Create strategic planning documents
- `/decide` - Quick decision framework with rationale

## System Architecture

This ClaudeKit PM system implements:

1. **Systematic Problem Decomposition** - Breaking complex problems into manageable components
2. **Comprehensive PRD Generation** - Multi-layer validation and verification
3. **Cross-functional Coordination** - Structured workflows for team alignment
4. **Consistency Maintenance** - Systematic verification and backtracking
5. **Scalable File System As Context** - Efficient AI-enhanced reasoning chains

## Long Chain-of-Thought Methodology

All workflows implement extended reasoning chains with:
- Multi-phase verification checkpoints
- Iterative refinement protocols
- Backtracking capabilities
- Error correction mechanisms
- Cross-validation between components
